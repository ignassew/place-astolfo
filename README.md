This repository was used to coordinate image template used to place astolfo on [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place).

And we did it successfully! Here's how it came out:

# Credits
This project was made possible by many different communities who worked together in a shared goal of placing Astolfo permamently on the internet's most popular canvas.
Without so many awesome people engaged in this project, we would have never made it:

- [r/placeastolfo](https://www.reddit.com/r/placeastolfo/)

- [MingCat](https://twitter.com/MingCate/status/1388206923166666759) - creator of the pixel art

There's a lot of people who deserve to be mentioned here, but I tried to make it as compact as possible. If you want to learn more about the project, feel free to look into the links above.

*See you in 2027!*
